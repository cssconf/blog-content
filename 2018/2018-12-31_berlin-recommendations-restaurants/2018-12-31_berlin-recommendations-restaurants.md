Berlin has a fantastic food culture and offers a great variety of culinary experiences. Here's a collection of some of our favourite places to grab a *yummy* bite:

##Cocolo Ramen
<span style="font-size:.85em;">**Paul-Lincke-Ufer 39-40, 10999 Berlin** ([map](https://goo.gl/maps/IGhcu)) | **Mon - Sat 12.00 - 23.00, Sun 18.00 - 23.00** | €€<span style="color:grey">€€</span>
**Gipsstr. 3, 10119 Berlin** ([map](https://goo.gl/maps/w0XJr))</span>

The Asian cuisine scene in Berlin is huge and [Cocolo Ramen](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Cocolo-Ramen-X-Berg/480234328730559) is right at the center of it. With locations in both Kreuzberg and Mitte, Cocolo Ramen serves craftily made mouth-watering noodle dishes, on par with their authentic Japanese counterparts. Cocolo Ramen in Kreuzberg is suitably located next to the popular Maybachufer canal, in a beautiful, green setting. The menu is simple and sweet and includes veggie options. Expect to pay between €7.5 - €10 per bowl.

##Umami
<span style="font-size:.85em;">**Knaackstraße 16, 10405 Berlin** ([map](https://goo.gl/maps/XsGRa)) | **Daily 12.00 - 23.30** | €€<span style="color:grey">€€</span></span>

Umami is an Asian fusion restaurant in Prenzlauerberg offering a wide variety of mostly Vietnamese / Thai dishes in a beautiful setting lit up by lanterns. Here you'll find an extensive menu of fantastic dishes, plus customized weekly specials. Expect to pay between €6.5 - €15 per main dish.

##Datscha
<span style="font-size:.85em;">**Gabriel-Max-Straße 1, 10245 Berlin** ([map]) | **Mon - Sat from 10:00, Sun 9:00 - 15.00** | €€<span style="color:grey">€€</span></span>

[Datscha](http://cafe-datscha.de/) is a Russian Café-Bar in Friedrichshain serving delicious Russian food. It's a favourite because of its great ambiance, yummy dishes, reasonable prices and, of course, its excellent selection of vodkas. There are vegetarian dishes on offer here and you can have a look at the menu [online]((http://cafe-datscha.de/speisekarte.html)). Expect to pay between €9 - €14 for a main course.

##Sauvage
<span style="font-size:.85em;">**Pflügerstraße 25, 12047 Berlin** ([map]) | **Tue - Sun 18:00 - 00:00** | €€€<span style="color:grey">€</span></span>

[Sauvage](http://sauvageberlin.com/en/) prides itself in being the world's first Paleo restaurant. It offers a good variety of dishes made from largely unprocessed / raw ingerdients. You can also check out their menu [online](http://cafe-datscha.de/speisekarte.html). Prices are a little higher here, main courses average ca. €15.

##Spätzleexpress
<span style="font-size:.85em;">**Wiener Straße 11, 10999 Berlin** ([map]) | **Mon - Sun 12.00 - 22.00** | €<span style="color:grey">€€€</span></span>

[Spätzleexpress](http://www.spaetzleexpress.de/) is a non-fancy, self-service type of establishment. It made our list because it offers typical German dishes and we swear by its *Spätzle*, a German type of pasta... [Wikipedia can explain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sp%C3%A4tzle) better. Food here is delicious, filling, and cheap! Spätzleexpress has [an extensive menu](http://www.spaetzleexpress.de/en/food/) with daily specials. Expect to pay between €5 - €7 per meal.
